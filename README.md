## What is Dope Dobes Mafia?

Dope Dobes Mafia is an NFT (non-fungible token) collection of 9,999+ 3D pieces of digital art that come with real-world benefits and future game applications. You can think of them almost as a digital trading card like the carboard sports trading cards that have been around since the 1860s. However, these digital assets can be built upon using new blockchain and Web3 technology to increase the value.

Each Dobe is completely unique and randomly generated using 7 properties/traits that create rarity: 

| Traits      | Styles    | Variations                                            |
| :---------- | :-------: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Fur         |     1     | Black, Brown, Blue, Pink, Red                         |
| Eyes        |     1     | Grey, Brown, Blue, Green, Purple, Red, Yellow         |
| Upper Body  |     3     | Grey, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red, Yellow, None  |
| Chain       |     3     | Gold, Silver, Black, None                             |
| Jewlery     |     6     | Gold, Silver Black, None                              |
| Background  |     6     | Black, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red               |
| Print       |     2     | DDM Logo, None                                        |

You can use your Dobe to race digitally for rewards, to use as your character in future metaverse games, and/or just collect to see the value grow. Dope Dobes Mafia also has future plans to host exclusive IRL entertainment events, drop merchandise such as apparel and dog accessories with our partners, and much more.

## How do I purchase?

The Dope Dobes Mafia NFTs live on the Ethereum Blockchain and are "minted". To mint means to publish a completely unique digital asset to the blockchain adopted (we use "adopt" to align with our brand but the industry term is "mint", which means the same as "purchase") on our website [here](https://dopedobesmafia.com/mint.php).

Cost: **0.07 ETH**

1. Create a MetaMask wallet using the mobile app or an internet browser
2. Add Ethereum (crypto currency) to your wallet by purchasing through an exchange (Ex. Moonpay)
3. Navigate to [https://dopedobesmafia.com/mint.php](https://dopedobesmafia.com/mint.php)
4. MetaMask will automatically open, be sure to connect your wallet
5. Enter in the quantity of NFTs you'd like to purchase
6. Click "Adopt"
7. Your wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction
8. Wait a minute or two for the transaction to confirm
9. Congratulations, your Dobe should now be in the NFTs tab of your wallet

## Why the Dobermann breed?

The Dobermann breed was chosen as the heart and soul of this project out of love for all dogs but specifically influenced by the adoption of a founder's rescued Dobermann. At the project's core is the motivation to allow all dogs to experience the love, compassion, and life they deserve. 6.25% of all profits are donated to no-kill dog shelters around the United States.

## Woofonomics

### Community Wallet

The Community Wallet is a separate MetaMask wallet hard-coded into the smart contract to automatically recieve 18.75% of all profites whenever Ethereum is withdrawn from the contract. The allocation of the funds inside the Community Wallet is decided on solely by the holders of Dope Dobes Mafia NFTs through a vote. Read more about your eligibility to vote on the community wallet [here](#community-wallet-vote).

### RaceTrack

A main deliverable of the Dope Dobes Mafia project is to provide a game where holders can race their digital Dobe for rewards. A holder will purchase the required RaceKit that will randomly generate their Dobe's base stats with 100/500 possible stat amounts. Through various engaging activites, holders of a RaceKit can increase their Dobe's stats. However, the scoring algorith does account for the underdog but higher stats will give Dobes a higher probability of winning. 

The RaceTrack will consist 3 versions: 

#### Beta (Free to race and earn giveaways)

The Beta version will allow holders to register for races for FREE via the Dope Dobes Mafia website but will NOT include a real-time viewing experience. Racers will be required to view the race via discord stream and must be present in the corresponding Twitter Space to participate/win the reward.

#### V1 (Requires RaceKit)

The RaceTrack V1 will require the purchase of an additional NFT (RaceKit) made available for mint via the Dope Dobes Mafia website. The RaceKit will contain a set of randomly generated stats (100 out of the 500 total stat points possible) and can be assigned to a single Dobe at a time using the function on the RaceKit smart contract (assigning a Dobe will also be available the website). This functionality allows for the sale of a RaceKit independent of a Dobe. 

#### Metaverse

The Metaverse is the final version of the RaceTrack and will include an open-world experience for Dobe holders to engage with the community, show-off their collection of Dobe accessories, and much more TBA. 

### Foster Protocol

The Foster Protocol is simply the idea of watching for neglectful owners listing their Dobes way under the floor price. If a holder sweeps a Dobe off the floor (purchases under current floor price), they will be rewarded with Dobe Poo. 

#### Dobe Poo

Dobe Poo is a separate NFT collection of 2D poo that is simulates real dog doo-doo and it is NOT a bad thing! Because a holder has swept a Dobe off the floor, that increases the value of the collection and in return should be rewarded. Rank your Dobe Poo up to level 50 using NFT Scribe and you will be rewarded an additional Dope Dobes Mafia NFT for FREE.

### Boarding (Staking)

"Boarding" is our version of staking where holders can "board" their Dobermann as a promise to not sell in return for loyalty rewards and raise the value of the collection. For every day that your Dobe is staked, you will earn "treats" throughout our website that can be redeemed in our marketplace. Read more about our Marketplace [here](#marketplace).

#### Marketplace

The Marketplace is a page on our website where "treats" earned through staking can be redeemed for physical merchandise. The Marketplace is periodically stocked with items including, but not limited to: limited apparel from Dope Dobes Mafia and partners; Dog toys, food, and accessories; NFTs from the community; and much more. As the Dope Dobes Mafia collection accrues revenue, a percentage will be allocated to stocking the Marketplace to continually provide the opportunity for holders to obtain exclusive merchandise. 

#### Community Wallet Vote

Holders who are currently boarding are eligible to vote on where the community wallet's funds are allocated. Holders are also able to suggest options to be included in the vote.

## Future Plans
