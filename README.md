### Boarding (Staking)

"Boarding" is our version of staking where holders can "board" their Dobermann as a promise to not sell in return for loyalty rewards and raise the value of the collection. For every day that your Dobe is staked, you will earn "treats" throughout our website that can be redeemed in our marketplace. Read more about our Marketplace [here](#marketplace).

#### Marketplace

The Marketplace is a page on our website where "treats" earned through staking can be redeemed for physical merchandise. The Marketplace is periodically stocked with items including, but not limited to: limited apparel from Dope Dobes Mafia and partners; Dog toys, food, and accessories; NFTs from the community; and much more. As the Dope Dobes Mafia collection accrues revenue, a percentage will be allocated to stocking the Marketplace to continually provide the opportunity for holders to obtain exclusive merchandise.
